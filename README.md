* Live Version: [Dad Jokes App](https://dad-jokes-gsindar.vercel.app/)

* This project was inspired by: [50 Projects In 50 Days](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/)

* ### Description

* In this project, I created a website which is fetching random jokes. I used vanilla CSS and vanilla JS with native fetch api including .then() and async/await methods.
